In our final class of Introduction to AI, we were asked to write about which agent type we liked or prefered most out of the five mentioned by [Russell & Norvig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent#CITEREFRussellNorvig2003) in their book. Here I discuss about it.

## The agent types:
As stated earlier, there are 5 types of agents.

* Simple reflex agent
* Model based reflex agent
* Goal based
* Utility based
* Learning agent

## Preferred agent:
Among these 5, I prefer the learning agent due to it's generaliaztion of the other 4 agents. To explain why, we first need to look at how the learning agent works.
